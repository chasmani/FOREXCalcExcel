Excel based simulation for FOREX trading backtesting

Ticker/price data is input and the Excel sheet simulates a trading strategy based on the ticker data, making virtual trades and collating the results  

The trading strategy involves  observing the simple trend in a changeable time period before the trade time.  

This trading strategy is based on the theory that the FOREX amrket is essentially a zero-sum iterative game played between multiple heterogenous players, as such any public strategic meme that is succesful will inevitably eventually change the market and no longer be succesful. Success then requires a trading strategy based on an unexplored or unpublic niche.  This approach was achieved here by using a simplistic statistical measure that is not used by other traders.  

This approach returned a 53% win-loss ratio which is good but not enough to overcome the costs of bets due to spreads.
